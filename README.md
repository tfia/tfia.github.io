## Bai Jiane Quotes

This static page can randomly displays saved quotes. 

You can easily modify the quotes data and change it into someone else's quotes site.

Simply fork this repo, and change the quotes in `bai.json`. You can also edit `index.html` to change the appearance of the page. Edit `CNAME` to configure your custom domain(if you have one). Then you can start the Github Pages service of the repo or push the repo to Vercel to deploy it.

It's pretty low-tech, but it looks great:)
